# Q-7 : Explain what does django-admin.py make messages command is used for?

# ans:

# This command line executes over the entire source tree of the current directory and abstracts all the strings marked for translation.  It makes a message file in the locale directory.

# The django-admin.py make messages command is used to collect all the translation strings from the Django  project and create or update the language files for translation.

# This command searches through the project's sourse code and templates, extracts all the translatable strings, and creates or updates the .po files for each language specified in the project settings.

# These .po files contain the original strings and their corresponding translations, and they are used by the Django internalization(i18n) framework to provide multilingual support for the project.

# Once the .po files are created or updated, translators can use tools like,

# django-admin.py comilemessages

# to compile them into .mo files, which are then used by Django to display the translated content to users based on their language preferences.
